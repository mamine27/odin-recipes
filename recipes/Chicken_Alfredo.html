    <h2>Steps to Make Chicken Alfredo</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes per side. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
        <li>Add the grated Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning to the sauce, stirring until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. If using, add a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Slice the cooked chicken breasts into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked fettuccine pasta and sliced chicken to the skillet, tossing to coat in the Alfredo sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the grated mozzarella cheese over the top and continue to cook until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately.</li>
