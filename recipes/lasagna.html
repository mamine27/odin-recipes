    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering pasta sheets with a variety of ingredients, typically including a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and cheese. The process begins by preparing the meat sauce, which usually involves sautéing ground beef or pork with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, seasoned with herbs like basil and oregano. This mixture is simmered until it develops a deep, savory flavor. At the same time, the béchamel sauce is made by melting butter, adding flour to create a roux, and then whisking in milk until the sauce is smooth and thickened. Both sauces are essential for adding depth and creaminess to the dish.</p>
    <p>To assemble the lasagna, a layer of cooked lasagna noodles is placed at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a generous spread of the meat sauce, a layer of béchamel, and a sprinkling of cheese, often mozzarella and Parmesan. This layering process is repeated, typically three to four times, finishing with a top layer of sauce and cheese. The lasagna is then baked in the oven until the cheese on top is golden and bubbly, and the dish is heated through. Once baked, it’s recommended to let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving, allowing the layers to set and making it easier to cut into neat portions.</p>
